# **Austin Nana Dwomoh**

**CS + Data Analytics @ Augustana College (’27)**  
Building resilient software systems that don’t fall apart when real users touch them.

I focus on automation, data infrastructure, and services that operate continuously.

## **What I’m doing right now**

- Shipping bots, APIs, and web systems used by actual people  
- Turning messy real-world processes into deterministic, observable pipelines  
- Running production deployments on DigitalOcean, PM2, and Apache2  
- Exploring AI-assisted systems that scale beyond the demo stage

## **Projects**

### 🛰 **Aries** — *Esports Competition Platform*  
`Django · PostgreSQL · Bootstrap · JavaScript`  
A full-stack platform for clan-based esports tournaments. Manages roles, fixtures, and match results with backend-enforced rules, removing the chaos of Discord spreadsheets and manual coordination.

**Live:** https://aries.austindwomoh.xyz  
**GitHub:** https://github.com/AustinDwomoh/aries

**Key Capabilities**
- Domain-driven models for clans, players, and match workflows  
- Backend-enforced permissions for admins, leaders, and players  
- Persistent performance and tournament stats tied to real matches

### 🐍 **Ouroboros** — *Discord Tournament Automation Engine*  
`Python (discord.py) · PM2 · SQLite/Postgres`  
A 24/7 bot that handles tournament logistics, media lookups, and finance tracking. Designed to survive restarts, handle rate limits, and expose consistent behavior over time.

**GitHub:** https://github.com/AustinDwomoh/Ouroboros  
**Invite:** https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1280610867846578309

**Capabilities**
- Match scheduling, reminders, and leaderboards  
- Media and data integrations via third-party APIs  
- Modular commands that scale without core rewrites

### ⚖️ **Libra API** — *Automated Job Intelligence Platform*  
`FastAPI · PostgreSQL · Pytest · CI/CD`  
Aggregates and annotates internship and job listings with verified visa-sponsorship context. Eliminates guesswork for international applicants by surfacing credible employers backed by USCIS data.

**Live:** https://libra.austindwomoh.xyz  
**GitHub:** https://github.com/AustinDwomoh/libra

**Highlights**
- Multi-source scraping + normalization pipeline  
- Sub-100ms API responses with caching and background workers  
- Sponsorship scoring based on historical employer filings

---

## **Skills Snapshot**

**Languages**  
Python, Java, JavaScript, SQL, PHP

**Backend**  
FastAPI, Django, REST APIs, Supabase/Postgres

**Frontend**  
React, Tailwind, Bootstrap, JavaFX

**Infra & DevOps**  
DigitalOcean · Apache2 · PM2 · GitHub Actions (CI/CD) · cPanel

**Strengths**
- Debugging production failures instead of theorizing about them  
- Schemas that prevent invalid states by design  
- Abstractions that reduce cognitive load rather than inflate it

---

## **Working Principles**

- If services can’t restart cleanly, the system is lying  
- Observability > hero debugging  
- Correctness scales further than cleverness  
- A feature without tests is a rumor, not a capability

<!--
To Future Me:
- Keep Libra & Ouroboros pinned — they demonstrate leverage
- Aries becomes more valuable as bracket + analytics systems mature
- Don’t publish claims you can’t measure
